The following changes have been made between LKRG 0.2 and 0.3

 *) [ED] Fix false possitive caused via potential race condition when child process might be faster than mother returning from the fork().
 *) [ED] Change the logic and loglevel for message printed when racy situation at fork() appears.
 *) [CI] Change assigned probabilities when integrity routine will be fired


The following changes have been made between LKRG 0.1 and 0.2:

*) Add support for being loaded at early boot stage (e.g. from initramfs)
*) [CI] Add a new sysctl to control whether LKRG performs code integrity checks
   on random events (or only at regular intervals)
*) Reduce performance impact, e.g. in our specific test case:
   -> Average cost of running a fully enabled LKRG => 2.5%
   -> Average cost of running LKRG without the code integrity checks on
      random events (disabled with the new sysctl) => 0.7%
*) [CI] Fix a potential deadlock bug caused by get_online_cpus() function,
   which might sleep if CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
*) [CI] Fix dynamic NOPs injected by *_JUMP_LABEL for MWESTMERE
*) [CI] Remove false positives caused by *_JUMP_LABEL in corner case scenarios
*) [ED] Remove false positives when kernel executes usermode helper binaries


The following changes have been made between LKRG 0.0 and 0.1:

*) Support RHEL 7.4 kernels
*) Make new compiler happy (gcc 7.3+)
*) Improve Makefile
*) Improve Exploit Detection performance and hardened 'off' flag
*) Add support for kernel 4.15
*) Use GPLv2 LICENSE
*) Add INSTALL, CHANGELOG and PATREONS file
*) Move SELinux integrity check to the workqueue
*) Fix how *_JUMP_LABEL is handled when 0xCC byte is injected
