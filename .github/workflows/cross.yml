# Notes:
#
# - There is harmless warning:
#
#     "[Warning] The requested image's platform (linux/arm64/v8) does not
#     match the detected host platform (linux/amd64) and no specific
#     platform was requested"
#
#   It's hard to remove, perhaps, because we using 'build' and not 'buildx',
#   which requires more setup.
#
# - git clean is not necessarily on GA, but added so it's easier to copy-paste
#   Dockerfile for manual runs.
