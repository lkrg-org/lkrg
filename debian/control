Description: Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)
 LKRG performs runtime integrity checking of the Linux kernel and detection of
 security vulnerability exploits against the kernel.
 .
 LKRG is a kernel module (not a kernel patch), so it can be built for and loaded
 on top of a wide range of mainline and distros' kernels, without needing to
 patch those.
 .
 That is only a dependency package to install the LKRG kernel module and also
 some systemd service in order to help to manage loading/unloading the module at
 system boot/shutdown.

Description: Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) Source Code and DKMS
 LKRG performs runtime integrity checking of the Linux kernel and detection of
 security vulnerability exploits against the kernel.
 .
 LKRG is a kernel module (not a kernel patch), so it can be built for and loaded
 on top of a wide range of mainline and distros' kernels, without needing to
 patch those.
 .
 This package uses DKMS to automatically build the LKRG kernel module.

 security vulnerability exploits against the kernel.
 .
 LKRG is a kernel module (not a kernel patch), so it can be built for and loaded
 on top of a wide range of mainline and distros' kernels, without needing to
