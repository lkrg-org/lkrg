# Additionally, this setting will read as 9 (custom) if an underlying setting
# is changed directly (potentially deviating from any of the profiles).
#
# Higher-numbered validation profiles provide higher likelihood of timely
# detection of an attack, but involve higher performance overhead and higher
# risk of incompatibility with other system software. Profiles 1 to 3 provide
# reasonable tradeoffs.
#
# lkrg.profile_validate=3 or higher is incompatible with VirtualBox hosts,
# where you need to use at most lkrg.profile_validate=2. However, there's no
# problem with setting lkrg.profile_validate=3 on Linux+LKRG guest systems in
# VirtualBox VMs.
#
# lkrg.profile_validate=4 (paranoid) is incompatible with many distributions
# and has unreasonably high performance overhead and poor scalability while not
# necessarily providing a practically relevant improvement in attack detection.
#
# Choosing a validation profile sets the following underlying settings, which
# are described further below: kint_validate, pint_validate, pcfi_validate,

#
# Default: "3"
#lkrg.profile_validate = 3

# Quick choice of a pre-defined profile controlling whether and how LKRG acts
# on detected integrity violations and attacks. Allowed values are 0 (log and
# accept), 1 (selective), 2 (strict), and 3 (paranoid). Additionally, this
# setting will read as 9 (custom) if an underlying setting is changed directly
# (potentially deviating from any of the profiles).
#
# Higher-numbered enforcement profiles provide higher likelihood of mitigating
# a compromise or stopping an attack, but also a higher risk of interfering
# with normal system behavior and to a worse extent in case of false positives.
#
# lkrg.profile_enforce=0 can be used for safe testing of LKRG, where any
# detected violations and attacks are logged but no enforcement is performed.
# It can also be useful where LKRG is meant to act as a sensor within a larger
# security monitoring and response setup (e.g., network-wide).
#
# lkrg.profile_enforce=1 performs selective enforcement - log only for kernel
# integrity violations, varying effective actions ranging from killing a task
# to triggering a kernel panic for other types of violations and attacks.
# This mode is extremely unlikely to panic the kernel on a false positive.
#
# lkrg.profile_enforce=2 performs strict enforcement - varying effective
# actions for all types of violations and attacks, including triggering a
# kernel panic for kernel integrity violations.
#
# lkrg.profile_enforce=3 performs the most paranoid enforcement - kernel panic
# for all types of violations and attacks.
#
# Choosing an enforcement profile sets the following underlying settings, which
# are described further below: kint_enforce, pint_enforce, pcfi_enforce,
# umh_enforce, smep_enforce, and smap_enforce.
#
# Also relevant is the kernel's kernel.panic sysctl and panic parameter, which
# makes the system reboot on kernel panic. For example, kernel.panic=60 in
# /etc/sysctl.conf or in a file under the /etc/sysctl.d directory, or panic=60
# on the kernel's command-line, will make the system reboot in 60 seconds after
# a panic. This provides a brief opportunity to read the panic message on the
# console yet makes an unattended server try to come back up on its own.
#
# Profiles are currently available via sysctl only - there are no corresponding
# module parameters. However, the individual underlying settings, which are
# described further below, do have their corresponding module parameters.
#
# Default: "2"
#lkrg.profile_enforce = 2

# Whether or not to print a heartbeat message ("System is clean!" or "Tasks are
# clean!" depending on other configuration) whenever the global integrity
# checking routine completes with no violations detected. Allowed values are 0
# (don't print the message) and 1 (print the message if allowed by log_level).
#
# Default: "0"
#lkrg.heartbeat = 0

# LKRG's timer interval for periodic invocation of the global integrity
# checking routine, in seconds. Allowed values are 5 to 1800.
#
# Default: "15"
#lkrg.interval = 15

# Force LKRG to invoke the global integrity checking routine. If you set this
# to 1, the routine is immediately invoked and this sysctl is reset back to 0.
#
# Default: ""
#lkrg.trigger = 0

# LKRG's logging verbosity level. Allowed values are from 0 to 4 for normal
# builds or from 0 to 6 for debugging builds.
#
# Values of 4 and higher are meant for debugging only and produce too verbose
# logging for production use. Moreover, some messages logged at those high
# levels contain information useful for kernel vulnerability exploitation,
# making those log levels potentially mildly insecure (depending on other
# system configuration).
#
# Default: "3"
#lkrg.log_level = 3

# Whether or not to block further loading of kernel modules. Allowed values
# are 0 (no) and 1 (yes).
#
# This feature is meant primarily to prevent unintended user-triggered (or
# attacker-triggered) auto-loading of maybe-vulnerable modules provided in a
# distribution after all intended modules have already been loaded. This
# feature is not effective (nor is meant to be) against attackers who already
# have root privileges and try to load a module explicitly (they could simply
# flip this setting or even unload LKRG first).
#
# Please note that enabling this setting (too) early (e.g., using the module
# parameter or /etc/sysctl.*) may cause the system to fail to complete bootup
# (if required modules are still being loaded in later stages of bootup, which
# varies between distributions and system configurations).
#
# Also relevant is the kernel's kernel.modules_disabled sysctl, which fully
# disables module loading until the system is rebooted.
#
# Default: "0"
#lkrg.block_modules = 0

# Whether or not LKRG should hide itself from the lists of loaded modules and
# KOBJs. Allowed values are 0 (do not hide LKRG, or unhide it if previously
# hidden) and 1 (hide LKRG).
#
# Please note that LKRG can be easily detected by other means anyway, such as
# through the presence of its sysctl's.
#
# Default: "0"
#lkrg.hide = 0

# Whether and when to validate global kernel integrity. Allowed values are 0
# (disabled), 1 (only when manually triggered by lkrg.trigger), 2 (also
# periodically every lkrg.interval seconds), and 3 (also periodically every
# lkrg.interval seconds and probabilistically on certain other events).
#
# This currently applies to kernel and modules code and read-only data, global
# SELinux settings, and some CPU status registers/bits (WP, SMEP, SMAP, MSRs).
# (The validation and enforcement of SMEP, SMAP, and MSRs are separately
# controlled by their respective knobs described below, and SMEP and SMAP are
# validated much more frequently, not only as part of global kernel integrity.)
#
# Default: "3"
#lkrg.kint_validate = 3

# How to act on global kernel integrity violations. Allowed values are 0 (log
# once and accept new likely-compromised state as valid), 1 (log only for most
# violations, log the violation and restore previous state for SELinux and CPU
# WP bit), and 2 (panic the kernel).
#
# Note that lkrg.kint_enforce=1 is expected to produce repeated log messages on
# most kernel integrity violations, which can be noisy. Also note that
# lkrg.kint_enforce=2 is unfortunately the only way to make full use of LKRG's
# global kernel integrity validation. Running with lkrg.kint_validate=2 or
# higher but lkrg.kint_enforce set to 0 or 1 wastes CPU time on costly checks
# without achieving a corresponding security improvement, except that it might
# provide logs for post-mortem detection and analysis of a security compromise.
#
# Default: "2"
#lkrg.kint_enforce = 2

# Whether and when to validate process credentials integrity. Allowed values
# are 0 (disabled), 1 (validate a task's credentials just before it'd make use
# of the credentials), 2 (currently, it has the same meaning as 1), and 3
# (validate credentials of all tasks in the system whenever any task is about
# to make use of its credentials).
#
# Except with lkrg.pint_validate=0, we also validate the credentials of all
# tasks as part of LKRG's global integrity checking routine.
#
# lkrg.pint_validate=1 is sufficient to provide most of LKRG's potential at
# timely detection of exploits. lkrg.pint_validate=3 is a paranoid mode with
# high performance overhead yet likely a minuscule gain in security.

# Default: "2"
#lkrg.pint_validate = 2

# How to act on process credentials integrity violations. Allowed values are 0
# (log once and accept new likely-compromised state as valid), 1 (kill the

#
# In Linux kernel's terminology, which we also use here, a "task" refers to a
# thread, and threads of a program may technically have different credentials.
# Our enforcement of process credentials integrity is thus per-thread, and e.g.
# it might happen that we kill an individual compromised thread of a program.
#
# Default: "1"
#lkrg.pint_enforce = 1

# Whether and to what extent to validate Control Flow Integrity (CFI) on kernel
# functions that we monitor because of their usefulness for exploits' Return
# Oriented Programming (ROP) chains. Allowed values are 0 (disabled), 1 (only
# validate the stack pointer), and 2 (also validate all stack frames).
#
# Because of the very limited extent of validation performed, we call our CFI
# mechanism pCFI, for poor man's CFI.
#
# lkrg.pcfi_validate=2 is incompatible with VirtualBox hosts, where you need to
# use at most lkrg.pcfi_validate=1. However, there's no problem with setting
# lkrg.pcfi_validate=2 on Linux+LKRG guest systems in VirtualBox VMs.
#
# Default: "2"
#lkrg.pcfi_validate = 2

# How to act on pCFI violations. Allowed values are 0 (log only), 1 (kill the

#
# Default: "1"
#lkrg.pcfi_enforce = 1

# Whether and to what extent to validate uses of usermodehelper (UMH). Allowed
# values are 0 (validation disabled), 1 (allow only previously known programs),
# and 2 (completely block UMH).
#
# UMH can also be protected with pCFI regardless of this setting.
#
# UMH is a kernel-internal interface, which the kernel uses to invoke programs
# such as /sbin/modprobe (to auto-load a module on demand) and many others.
# When left unrestricted, UMH is convenient for kernel vulnerability exploits.
#
# Default: "1"
