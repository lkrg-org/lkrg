/*
 * pi3's Linux kernel Runtime Guard
 *
 * Component:
 *  - Intercept 'security_bprm_committing_creds' syscall
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - We are maintianing Red-Black tree of pid's for Exploit Detection feature.
 *    When process calls execve, we need to update RB tree.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *  - None
 *
 * Timeline:
 *  - 18.I.2021:   Replace one 'search_binary_handler' hook with two
 *                 independent one to reduce the race window while
 *                 the process is not being verified
 *  - 28.XII.2020: Replace various execve syscall hooks with one hook
 *                 of the function 'search_binary_handler'
 *  - Created:     18.IX.2017
